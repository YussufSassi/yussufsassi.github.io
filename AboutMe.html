<h2>Why I created this website</h2>
<p>I created this website because i was looking for something to do in my free time, like a project that would take some time, so i learned html and CSS and began this website. Whilst looking for a topic I came across some Mozart music and it sort of inspired me to go along with the Art-Theme.So, here we are! </p>

 <h2> Who am I? </h2>
 <p> Hi, my name is Yussuf and I am from germany and currently live here. Before I got my pc I got into scripting and programming on a shitty old laptop, when I bought my Pc i just stopped and only played video games like Overwatch. But I stopped playing 2 weeks ago(05/29/2018 is the current date) so now I got back into programming. </p>



<p> Thanks for visting my wesbsite and appreciating art like I do.
